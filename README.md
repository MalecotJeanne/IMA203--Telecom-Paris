Learning variational and Bayesian methods for image filtering and segmentation.

### _Course description_:
This course introduces variational and Bayesian methods for image filtering and segmentation. Particular attention will be paid to the optimization methods used in this context. Applications from the fields of digital photography, aerial imaging and medical imaging will illustrate the usefulness of these approaches.
- variational methods
- deformable models
- Bayesian methods, Markov fields
- discrete optimization by graph cutting
